# Lemin
Lemin is a school project developed by 42 school.\
Lemin's goal is to get used to pathfinding algorithms and node-disjointed algorithms.\
The goal is to the parse ants from a room start to a room end and get them there as quickly as possible.\
The program is given a map that sets a number of room and links rooms to others.\
It reads the input from the standard input.\
Each turn ants can move from a room to another but there can only be 1 ant staying in a room (except for the start and end room)

The repo has a map generator you can use to create different maps and test the project\
The generator ouputs a map on the standard output


## Usage
Use make command to compile program\
**Map generator** :\
./generator --help\
**lemin** :\
./lemin < file
